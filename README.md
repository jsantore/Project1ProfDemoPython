This is the Professors version of the Project1, currently Sprint1

The secrets.py should be in the follwing format

    api_key="your api key here"

Once you install the packages from requirements.txt and reconstruct secrets.py

simply run main.py to run the sprint.

I've also added my sample database. It has 150 rows from fifteen runs rather than the 50 that I had you all do.
